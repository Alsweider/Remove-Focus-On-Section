# Remove-Focus-On-Section
Removes the element that features celebrities from the Criticker homepage.

There is an element on the Criticker.com homepage that features people from the film industry. Since these celebrities don't necessarily have anything to do with one's interests, it can be annoying for some users. The script specifically removes the "Focus On" section from the homepage.

Please note that it may be necessary to enable developer mode in Chrome browsers to run userscripts: https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209
